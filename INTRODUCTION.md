#1 Proof of Concepts

Welcome to Uniken's Proof of Concept documentation.

There are several types of proofs of concept that we recommend running to demonstrate the powerful security, usability and _flexibility_ of **REL-ID**, but each typically falls into one of the following categories:

1. VPN
2. Wrapped Web Application
3. Emmbedded SDK
4. Remote Desktop

Each type has its own characteristics, requirements, and stand-up time.  We've documented the basics of each type below so that we can best work with you on the PoC that most aligns to your enterprise needs.

We need to set a evaluation period for total of 90days outside of India
